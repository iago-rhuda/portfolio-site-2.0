My approach combines the technical rigor of software with the physical understanding of hardware, seeking solutions that not only work in models but are efficient in execution.<br><br>At 18, I founded and managed my own clothing brand, an experience that gave me critical insight into financial viability and resource allocation. I decided to close operations to prioritize my technical education after analyzing that the opportunity cost outweighed immediate returns. Today, I apply this analytical and proactive mindset to develop intelligent systems that solve real problems.",
